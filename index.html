            <p> Hi everyone, my name is Huilin Chen, I'm about to graduate in Fall 2019 with my bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering Technology. 
                <br>Since young I've always had been into technology by itself, such as the hardware, software, programming, networking and so on. 
                Before I had gotten to love programming one of the things that made me who I am today is the struggles I've been through.</br>
                <br>A lot of people that are like me thinks they love every single thing about the advanced of technology, however that is not the case. I started off to hate programming when I first entered my freshmen year of college. This was due to the lack of hands-on experience that left me feeling lost in what I really want to do within my major. Towards the end of my Sophmore year in college when I took a class that requires the use of an embedded system called, "Arduino", I was really able to grasp the fundamental of programming with the language 'C' with hands-on experience compare to just reading and memorizing vocabulary as what I had done in the first year for the language of python. As I continue to take courses that requires programming, such as C++ and Java. I was able to fall in love with programming.</br>
                <br>At times, when things get rough I would be on a continuous stress about whether or not I'm fitted for this, but my determination and self-motivation wouldn't allow me to give up.</br>
