                          Hi, My name is Karen Chen. You are probably wondering what is this
                          website about. Well I'll tell you what it is for. To start off, 
                          this website will be used to publish my creative games that I'll 
                          be making in the future. So, in order for me to get my "name"
                          or "branding" out here, I decided to introduce myself in this particular 
                          method by making a website that is still being underdeveloped. 
                          I hope you can spread word to word to your friends or family 
                          Because, within two years, you'll see this website will improve
                          drastically. There will be new contents that you will not be disappointed. 
                          While, I'm still in a development mode making both this website and my future games
                          by myself. If you are willing to support me, you can put in donations or tell your
                          friends and family! Thanks for taking the time to read about myself.
                          <br/> <br/>
                          Note: Please check regularly for more updates!
