                        <p>
                          Hi, My name is Huilin Chen. I recently graduated from New York City College of Technology,
                          with a Bachelor of Technology in Computer Engineering Technology. 

                          On my free time, I like to either hike, play video games or work on side projects to keep myself busy.
                        </p>

                          <li>
                            <Strong>Why Hiking?</Strong> 
                          </li> 
                          <p>
                            Any places that have mountainous view makes me feel alive and be part of nature in which it
                            helps me breathe in life, it also reminds me that "everything happens for a reason". </p>

                          <li>
                            <strong>Why Video Games?</strong> 
                          </li> 
                          <p>
                            Videos games helps me relieve the stress I built up, so its a way for me to relax. 
                            I usually play Simulation, Rhythm, Choices of Story, Gacha, or RPG Games.</p>

                          <li>
                            <strong>Why Side Projects?</strong> 
                          </li>
                          <p>
                            It helps keep my brain active, and learn new things that I probably didn't know about.
                            Usually, when i'm developing a project it takes me about a month to finish the part that I need to work on 
                            the most.</p>
                          
                          <p>
                            Now, you are probably wondering, why did I create this website. One of the reason I created it was so I can showcase
                            all of my future applications in the future.
  
                            While, I'm still in a development mode making both this website and my future games
                            by myself. I hope you look forward to what I'll be posting here, thanks for taking the time to read this!
