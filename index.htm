			Hi, My name is Karen Chen. You are probably wondering what is this website about. <br/>
			Well I'll tell you what it is for. To start off, this website will be used to publish my creative games <br/>
			that I'll be making in the future. So, in order for me to get my "name" or "branding" out here, I decided <br/>
			to introduce myself in this particular method by making a website that is still being underdeveloped. I hope you can spread word to word to your friends or family <br/> Because, within two years, you'll see this website will improve drastically. <br/> There will be new contents
			that you will not be disappointed. While, I'm still in a development mode making both this website and my future games by myself. <br/>
			If you are willing to support me, you can put in donations or tell your friends and family! Thanks for taking the time to read about myself. <br/>

			Note: Please check regularly for more updates!

				For more information and questions, you can shoot me an e-mail under the contact section <b>OR</b> Hit me up on social media!<br/>
				Everything will be listed under contact, thanks for your support!
